# Welcome to Miydi Maps

Miydi Maps is an extensive repository dedicated to providing highly detailed socio-economic data, meticulously compiled down to individual census tracts and zip codes. This initiative is designed to streamline the utilization of geographic data across various advanced applications, including Artificial Intelligence, data analytics, urban planning, and more, by eliminating the complexities of data parsing.

Our mission with Miydi Maps is to empower researchers, developers, and analysts by providing them with ready-to-use, granular level data that can significantly enhance the accuracy and relevance of their projects and analyses.

## 🌍 Data Granularity and Accessibility

Each dataset within Miydi Maps is structured to align with zip codes or census tracts, presenting a unique opportunity to access socio-economic data with unprecedented precision. This level of detail opens new avenues for localized research and development, offering insights that were previously challenging to obtain.

### 📈 Calculating Our Values: Identifying Actionable Opportunities

At Miydi Maps, our approach to data analysis is designed to unearth actionable opportunities that can drive informed decision-making and strategic planning. We employ a sophisticated weighted system, inspired by the principles of a bell curve distribution, to analyze and interpret our socio-economic datasets.

#### Bell Curve Analysis and Weighted System

Our methodology revolves around the segmentation of data into seven distinct tiers, with a deliberate focus on outliers before delving into more common data points. This tiered analysis allows us to assign varying weights to different segments of the data, with the bulk of our attention—and weight—placed on the middle tiers, where the most common values reside.

#### Data Tier Segmentation

- **Tier 1 & 7 (Outliers):** We start our analysis at the extremes, examining the top and bottom 10% of the dataset. These outliers often reveal unique, high-impact opportunities that deviate significantly from the norm.
- **Tier 2 & 6 (Next Level):** Following the outliers, we delve into the next 15% on either side of the data spectrum. This segment helps us understand slightly less extreme but still significant deviations from the average.
- **Tier 3 & 5 (Common Ground):** We then analyze the next 20% on both sides, moving closer to the most common data points. This segment represents more typical values but is still critical for identifying broader trends and patterns.
- **Tier 4 (Core Data):** At the heart of our analysis lies the middle 30%, the largest bracket, encapsulating the core of the bell curve. This central segment is where the most common values—and often the most significant insights—reside.

By structuring our analysis in this manner, we ensure a comprehensive understanding of the entire data spectrum, from the most unusual outliers to the prevalent norms. This tiered, weighted approach enables us to pinpoint precise areas of interest, highlight potential opportunities, and ultimately guide users toward data-driven decisions that can have a tangible impact on their projects or research.

Our commitment to this analytical methodology underscores our dedication to providing not just data, but insights that can catalyze action and foster innovation across a multitude of domains.


## 📊 Data Sources

We pride ourselves on the integrity and reliability of our data. All datasets in Miydi Maps are sourced from either official US Government agencies or reputable companies known for their high-quality data publications. Below is a list of our primary data sources:

- **United States Census Bureau**: Providing detailed demographic and socio-economic data down to the census tract level.
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics**: Offering insights into employment, labor market activity, and economic indicators at a granular geographical level.
- **National Center for Education Statistics**: Supplying educational statistics, including school district demographics and performance metrics.
- **Environmental Protection Agency**: Contributing environmental data, including pollution statistics and land use data by region.
- **Reputable Data Companies**: Partnering with leading data providers to include comprehensive datasets on consumer behavior, health statistics, and economic activities at the zip code level.

It's important to note that our repository contains the most recently released data from each source as of November 2023. However, given the varying publication frequencies (monthly, yearly, etc.) of our data sources, slight discrepancies in the timing of data releases may occur. Rest assured, Miydi Maps is continually updated to reflect the most current data available.

## 📜 Licensing

Miydi Maps is released under the Creative Commons License. We believe in the free exchange of information and encourage you to utilize, modify, and distribute our datasets as you see fit, whether for personal projects, academic research, or commercial applications.
