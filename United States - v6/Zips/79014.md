## Data Accuracy Disclaimer
It's important to note that the data provided here may contain errors or discrepancies and should be considered as 'close enough' for business applications and AI rather than a definitive source of truth. This data is aggregated from multiple sources, some of which publish information on wildly different intervals, leading to potential inconsistencies. Additionally, certain data points may not be corrected for Covid-related changes, further impacting accuracy. Moreover, the assumption that demographic trends are consistent throughout a region may lead to discrepancies, as trends often concentrate in areas of highest population density. As a result, dense areas may be slightly underrepresented, while rural areas may be slightly overrepresented, resulting in a more conservative dataset. Furthermore, the focus primarily on areas within US Major and Minor Statistical areas means that approximately 40 million Americans living outside of these areas may not be fully represented. Lastly, the historical background and area descriptions generated using AI are susceptible to potential mistakes, so users should exercise caution when interpreting the information provided.
